1) What is gravity?
a) A force that pushes objects away from each other
b) A force that pulls objects towards each other
c) A force that causes objects to float in space
d) A force that creates a vacuum 

2) Which factors affect the strength of gravity?
a) Mass and velocity of objects
b) Atmospheric pressure and temperature
c) Distance and time of day
d) Color and shape of objects%%%%1) b) A force that pulls objects towards each other 
Gravity is a force that pulls objects towards each other. It is responsible for the attraction between objects with mass, such as planets and moons.

2) a) Mass and velocity of objects 
The strength of gravity is influenced by the mass and velocity of objects. The greater the mass of an object, the stronger its gravitational pull. Similarly, objects with higher velocities will have a greater impact from gravity.

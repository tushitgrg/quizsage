1. What is the concept of satyagraha and how does it differ from physical force?
2. How did Mahatma Gandhi organize and use satyagraha movements to support different groups in India?
3. Why did Mahatma Gandhi launch a nationwide satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act, and how did the British administration respond to the protests?%%%%1. The concept of satyagraha, as described by Mahatma Gandhi, is a method of mass agitation that emphasizes the power of truth and the search for truth. It suggests that physical force is not necessary to fight against injustice, and that a satyagrahi (practitioner of satyagraha) can win the battle through non-violence. Satyagraha involves appealing to the conscience of the oppressor and persuading them to see and accept the truth, rather than using violence to force them to accept it.

2. Mahatma Gandhi organized and used satyagraha movements to support different groups in India by inspiring and mobilizing them to peacefully resist and protest against oppressive systems and policies. For example, he organized a satyagraha movement in Champaran in Bihar in 1917 to support peasants who were struggling against an oppressive plantation system. He also organized a satyagraha movement in Kheda district of Gujarat in the same year to support peasants who were unable to pay revenue due to crop failure and a plague epidemic. Additionally, he organized a satyagraha movement amongst cotton mill workers in Ahmedabad in 1918. These movements aimed to bring attention to the grievances of the affected groups and seek justice through peaceful means.

3. Mahatma Gandhi launched a nationwide satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act in 1919 because he considered the Act to be unjust and repressive. The Rowlatt Act had given the British government extensive powers to suppress political activities and allowed for the detention of political prisoners without trial for two years. Gandhi believed that such unjust laws needed to be resisted through non-violent civil disobedience. The protests against the Rowlatt Act started with a hartal (general strike) on April 6, and rallies, strikes, and closures of shops were organized in various cities. In response to the popular upsurge, the British administration decided to clamp down on nationalists. Local leaders were arrested, and Gandhi himself was barred from entering Delhi. This led to further tensions, and on April 10, the police fired upon a peaceful procession in Amritsar, which provoked widespread attacks on banks, post offices, and railway stations. Martial law was imposed and General Dyer took command to suppress the protests.

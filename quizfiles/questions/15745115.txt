3. What was the objective of the nationwide satyagraha launched by Mahatma Gandhi against the Rowlatt Act?%%%%1. The main principle behind satyagraha according to Mahatma Gandhi is the power of truth and the need to search for truth. It emphasizes that physical force is not necessary to fight against injustice if the cause is true. Through non-violence and appealing to the conscience of the oppressor, a satyagrahi can win the battle.

2. Mahatma Gandhi successfully organized satyagraha movements in India by inspiring and mobilizing various groups of people. He traveled to different places like Champaran in Bihar, Kheda district in Gujarat, and Ahmedabad to support and lead the struggles of peasants and cotton mill workers. He used non-violent civil disobedience and peaceful protests to gather support and bring attention to the issues.

3. The objective of the nationwide satyagraha launched by Mahatma Gandhi against the Rowlatt Act was to protest against the unjust laws that gave the government enormous powers to repress political activities and allowed detention of political prisoners without trial for two years. Gandhi wanted to mobilize non-violent civil disobedience to challenge and resist these laws, starting with a hartal (general strike) on April 6. The satyagraha aimed to raise awareness, disrupt the administration, and put pressure on the British government to repeal the Rowlatt Act.

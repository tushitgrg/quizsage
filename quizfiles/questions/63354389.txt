1. How does satyagraha differ from physical force when fighting against injustice?
2. What were the main objectives of Mahatma Gandhi's satyagraha movements?
3. How did the British administration respond to the satyagraha movements and the proposed Rowlatt Act?%%%%1. Satyagraha differs from physical force in that it emphasizes the power of truth and non-violence as a means of fighting against injustice. Instead of using aggression or seeking vengeance, satyagrahis rely on appealing to the conscience of their oppressors and persuading them to see the truth. Satyagraha believes that if the cause is true and the struggle is against injustice, physical force is not necessary to win the battle.
2. The main objectives of Mahatma Gandhi's satyagraha movements were to fight against specific injustices and oppressive systems. For example, in the Champaran movement, the objective was to inspire peasants to struggle against the oppressive plantation system. In the Kheda movement, the objective was to support peasants who were unable to pay revenue due to crop failure and a plague epidemic. The aim was to bring about change and alleviate the suffering of the affected people.
3. The British administration responded to the satyagraha movements and the proposed Rowlatt Act with repression and violence. The Rowlatt Act, which gave the government extensive powers to repress political activities and allowed detention without trial for two years, was opposed by Mahatma Gandhi and he called for non-violent civil disobedience against it. The British administration, alarmed by the popular upsurge and fearing disruption of communication, clamped down on nationalists. They picked up local leaders, barred Mahatma Gandhi from entering Delhi, and imposed martial law in response to attacks on banks, post offices, and railway stations. The repression and violence used by the British administration further fueled the nationalist movement in India.

The concept of satyagraha is a method of mass agitation that Mahatma Gandhi developed to challenge conventional methods of resistance. Satyagraha emphasizes the power of truth and the need to seek truth. It suggests that physical force is not necessary to fight against injustice if the cause is true. Instead of seeking vengeance or being aggressive, a satyagrahi (practitioner of satyagraha) can win the battle through non-violence by appealing to the conscience of the oppressor. Satyagraha challenges the idea that violence is the only way to resist and shows that truth and non-violence can ultimately triumph.

2. Mahatma Gandhi successfully organized satyagraha movements in different parts of India by mobilizing and inspiring people to join in the struggle against injustice. He traveled to Champaran in Bihar in 1917 to inspire peasants to resist the oppressive plantation system. He also organized a satyagraha movement in the Kheda district of Gujarat in 1917 to support peasants who were unable to pay revenue due to crop failure and a plague epidemic. In 1918, Gandhi went to Ahmedabad to organize a satyagraha movement among cotton mill workers. Through his leadership and persuasive abilities, Gandhi was able to unite people and create a sense of solidarity in these movements.

3. Mahatma Gandhi decided to launch a nationwide satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act in 1919 due to its unjust provisions that repressed political activities and allowed for the detention of political prisoners without trial for two years. Gandhi saw the Rowlatt Act as an oppressive measure that violated the principles of justice and freedom. He wanted to resist and disobey this unjust law through non-violent civil disobedience. The widespread protests and unrest were a result of the popular upsurge and the British administration's clampdown on nationalists. The police firing upon a peaceful procession in Amritsar further escalated the situation, leading to attacks on banks, post offices, and railway stations and the imposition of martial law by General Dyer. Gandhi's decision to launch a nationwide satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act played a significant role in mobilizing people and garnering support for the movement against British repression.

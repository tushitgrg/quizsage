2. How did Mahatma Gandhi successfully organize satyagraha movements in various places in India?
3. What was the Rowlatt Act and why did Mahatma Gandhi decide to launch a nationwide satyagraha against it?%%%%1. The concept of satyagraha, as believed by Mahatma Gandhi, emphasized the power of truth and the pursuit of truth. It stated that physical force was not necessary in the fight against injustice, as a satyagrahi could win the battle through non-violence and by appealing to the conscience of the oppressor. Gandhi believed that truth would ultimately triumph, and that this non-violent approach could unite all Indians.

2. Mahatma Gandhi successfully organized satyagraha movements in various places in India. In 1917, he inspired peasants in Champaran, Bihar to struggle against the oppressive plantation system. He also organized a satyagraha in 1917 to support the peasants of the Kheda district in Gujarat who were affected by crop failure and a plague epidemic. Additionally, in 1918, Gandhi organized a satyagraha movement among cotton mill workers in Ahmedabad.

3. The Rowlatt Act, passed in 1919, gave the British government enormous powers to repress political activities and allowed for the detention of political prisoners without trial for up to two years. Mahatma Gandhi decided to launch a nationwide satyagraha against this act because he believed in non-violent civil disobedience against unjust laws. The act was seen as an oppressive measure, and Gandhi wanted to mobilize a peaceful protest against it. The British administration responded to the popular upsurge with repression, leading to further protests and eventually the imposition of martial law in certain areas, such as Amritsar.

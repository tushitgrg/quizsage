1. What is isomerism and why is it important in chemistry?
2. How does structural isomerism differ from stereoisomerism?
3. Can you provide an example of a compound that exhibits geometrical isomerism and explain how the isomers differ in structure?%%%%1. Isomerism is the phenomenon where different compounds have the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements or spatial orientations. It is important in chemistry because isomers exhibit different physical properties, chemical reactivities, and biological activities. Studying isomerism allows chemists to understand and predict the behavior of compounds with similar compositions but different structures.

2. Structural isomerism arises from differences in the connectivity or arrangement of atoms within a molecule. This means that the isomers have different arrangements of atoms or functional groups in their structures. On the other hand, stereoisomerism arises from differences in the spatial arrangement of atoms within a molecule, often due to the presence of chiral centers or geometric restrictions. In stereoisomerism, the connectivity of atoms remains the same, but the spatial arrangement is different.

3. An example of a compound that exhibits geometrical isomerism is 2-butene. This compound consists of four carbon atoms bonded together, with a double bond between two of the carbon atoms. The isomers of 2-butene differ in the arrangement of substituents around the double bond. If the substituents on opposite sides of the double bond are different, it is called cis-2-butene. If the substituents on opposite sides of the double bond are the same, it is called trans-2-butene. The cis- and trans- isomers have different physical properties and reactivities due to the different spatial arrangements of the substituents around the double bond.

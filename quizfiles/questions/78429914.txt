1. What is the concept of satyagraha and how does it emphasize the power of truth?
2. How did Mahatma Gandhi successfully organize satyagraha movements in various places in India?
3. What was Mahatma Gandhi's rationale for launching a nationwide satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act?%%%%1. The concept of satyagraha is a method of mass agitation that emphasizes the power of truth. It suggests that if the cause is true and the struggle is against injustice, physical force is not necessary. Instead, satyagraha advocates for non-violence and appealing to the conscience of the oppressor. By fighting with truth and non-aggression, a satyagrahi can ultimately win the battle.

2. Mahatma Gandhi successfully organized satyagraha movements in various places in India. In 1917, he traveled to Champaran in Bihar to inspire peasants to struggle against the oppressive plantation system. He also organized a satyagraha in 1917 to support the peasants of the Kheda district in Gujarat who were affected by crop failure and a plague epidemic. In 1918, he went to Ahmedabad to organize a satyagraha movement among cotton mill workers.

3. Mahatma Gandhi launched a nationwide satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act in 1919. The Rowlatt Act was passed despite the united opposition of Indian members and gave the government enormous powers to repress political activities, including detaining political prisoners without trial for two years. Gandhi believed that non-violent civil disobedience was necessary to protest against unjust laws like the Rowlatt Act. This led to rallies and strikes in various cities, causing the British administration to clamp down on nationalists. The act of firing upon a peaceful procession in Amritsar further fueled the nationwide satyagraha movement.

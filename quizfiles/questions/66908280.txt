3. What was the Rowlatt Act and why did Mahatma Gandhi decide to launch a nationwide satyagraha against it?%%%%1. The concept of satyagraha, according to Mahatma Gandhi, is the use of truth and non-violence to fight against injustice. It differs from physical force because it emphasizes persuasion and appealing to the conscience of the oppressor, rather than resorting to aggression or vengeance. Satyagraha believes that if the cause is just, non-violence can ultimately triumph over the oppressor.
2. Mahatma Gandhi successfully organized and inspired satyagraha movements in India by traveling to different regions and addressing the grievances of the people. He went to places like Champaran and Kheda, where he mobilized peasants and workers to fight against oppressive systems and demand their rights. Gandhi's leadership and belief in the power of truth and non-violence resonated with the masses, leading to the success of these movements.
3. The Rowlatt Act was a repressive law passed by the British government in India, which gave them extensive powers to suppress political activities and detain political prisoners without trial for up to two years. Mahatma Gandhi decided to launch a nationwide satyagraha against this act because he believed it was unjust and violated the principles of truth and non-violence. He called for non-violent civil disobedience, including a hartal (general strike), to protest against this law and to demand its repeal. The widespread participation and popular upsurge in response to this call alarmed the British administration and led to a clampdown on nationalists, eventually resulting in the Amritsar Massacre.

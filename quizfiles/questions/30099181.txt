Satyagraha differed from traditional methods of agitation and resistance in that it emphasized the power of truth and non-violence. Instead of using physical force, satyagraha aimed to win the battle through non-violent means and by appealing to the conscience of the oppressor. It sought to persuade people to see the truth rather than forcing them to accept it through violence.

2. The main principles and beliefs behind Mahatma Gandhi's concept of satyagraha were the power of truth, non-violence, and the necessity to search for truth. Gandhi believed that if the cause was just and the struggle was against injustice, physical force was not necessary to fight the oppressor. He emphasized the importance of appealing to the conscience of the oppressor and believed that truth and non-violence were the ultimate weapons to bring about social change.

3. Mahatma Gandhi successfully organized and carried out satyagraha movements in various places in India by inspiring and mobilizing different groups of people. In Champaran, he motivated peasants to struggle against the oppressive plantation system. In Kheda, he organized a satyagraha to support peasants affected by crop failure and a plague epidemic who were demanding relaxation of revenue collection. In Ahmedabad, he led a satyagraha movement among cotton mill workers. His success can be attributed to his ability to connect with people at a grassroots level, his charismatic leadership, and the strong moral principles underlying satyagraha.
